# Project Title- OBSTACLE DETECTION USING AI


# Project Description

People while driving face several problems in their life, one of these problems that is the most important one is detection the obstacles when they are driving. Our research is on obstacle detection in order to reduce accidents on road and other difficulties for driving people. To help the people the visual world has to be transformed into the audio world with the potential to inform them about obstacles. In this paper algorithm for real time detection and tracking of obstacle is proposed by deep learning. Obstacle detection is one of the major applications in deep learning.
